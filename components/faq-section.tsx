    question: "What exactly is a \"concept\"?",
    answer:
      "A concept is a self-contained unit of backend behavior—like Post, Password, or Subscription—that bundles its state and the actions you can perform on it. In What You See Is What It Does: A Structural Pattern for Legible Software (Meng & Jackson, 2025), concepts are defined as independent services with clear, user-facing purposes. Conceptual turns that idea into a practical building block: a concept is the design unit behind your APIs and services, ready to be generated, tested, and reused.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from a normal API or microservice template?",
    answer:
      "Microservices and APIs are implementations. Concepts are the design unit behind them: the data, actions, invariants, and coordination rules. Conceptual gives you reusable, high-level building blocks you can re-implement however you want, and a hub to share them.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to adopt a specific framework or language?",
    answer:
      "No. Conceptual is framework-agnostic. Our tools help you author specs and generate starting points for multiple stacks. You choose how far you go—from \"just use the spec as design documentation\" to \"use the generated code and containers in production.\"",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this production-ready or just for teaching / prototyping?",
    answer:
      "We aim for both. The spec-first approach makes Conceptual great for teaching and design reviews, but the generated artifacts are meant to be testable and deployable. You can start with prototypes and gradually harden concepts as your system grows.",
